The project is  a side project im doing for fun - still criticism is greatly appreciated. I am rather new to APK programming in android studio.

# Issues
The app has issues dealing with native changes to screen size. For optimal execution it should be run with no "screen zoom" of any kind.  
  
**Samsung Galaxy S(X):**  
Make sure your 'screenzoom' is set to 'small' (Settings > Screen > Fonttype and screenzoom > screenzoom = small) for optimal display. Buttons and text can bug out and go out of bounds if this is not set.
